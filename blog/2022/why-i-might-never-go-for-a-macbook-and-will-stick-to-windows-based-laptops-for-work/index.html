<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I recently bought an Intel-corei7 powered Lenovo laptop with Windows 11 in it, and I must say my soul is satisfied with the choice that I made.</p> <blockquote>Being in the US and not opting for a MacBook “deliberately” was strange to many of my colleagues.</blockquote> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dRzex8sGuE8ZeuhCvF3gUA.png"></figure> <p>I am a computational chemist by profession, and it is my conscious decision not to own a MacBook for work. Of course, I made my decision after working on one, for a while. I found myself least productive and mostly “entertained” while using the MacBook. Here I justify my decision and if you are a person whose work ethos matches mine, this might help you make a more informed decision.</p> <p>Let me be clear about my idea of a laptop. I want my laptop to be powerful and robust which can last for a long time. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want to do heavy computation on my laptop, but a slight workload should not burn it. On top of that, if it has a sleek design, it’s <em>cherry on the cake</em>. I am the kind of person who likes to upgrade his laptop rather than replace it for silly reasons. And that’s my first point. MacBook and MacOS never gave me a feeling of openness, the freedom to tinker, neither in terms of their hardware nor the software. You would not dare to repair a MacBook by yourself even if it is a small adjustment. You can’t even get your RAM upgraded without tearing down the machine. The design strategy of MacBook is so minimalistic that they just provide two USB-c port for everything. This is totally against my idea of work that often requires to extend the display or interact with other gadgets. With all the external extensions required for a MacBook, it surely can’t be called a LAP-TOP.</p> <p>Getting to apps and softwares; who doesn’t like free/open-source softwares for accomplishing small but relevant tasks. But most of the freely available softwares available on the internet are not designed for macOS. Even the third-party package manager, Homebrew, home to many free packages, is not actively supported by macOS distribution and does not come preinstalled. I completely agree with how Homebrew describes itself: “Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple didn’t”. In fact, Apple owes big time to Homebrew. Instead, it promotes its “slow” AppStore, heavily backed by engineers at Silicon Valley, either filled with useless packages or asking money even for notepad alternatives. Apple is so averse to supporting free softwares/libraries, that it completely removed support for widely used OpenGL for graphics display and replaced it with Metal, a new alternative hardware-accelerated graphics API. I am not against modernization but give me time to adapt. Most of the GUI applications developed using OpenGL for long time, are left with no choice but to restrict themselves to Linux or Windows environments. Metal is just an overkill for such GUI projects. Most of the computational tools used in my area of work are not necessarily developed by engineers working in Silicon-Valley, but they serve the purpose very well. These tools as well as their dependencies are generally Linux-friendly and often run into problems on fancier and newer macOS. But the compatibility of these tools is not related to noobness of the developers. The macOS itself is so intertwined with the MacBook hardware that it leaves no option but to buy a new laptop if you want newer features of most recent macOS. And indeed, Apple does not believe in back-compatibility. I should say <em>a good survival strategy</em>.</p> <p>The most important aspect of any laptop through which we interact with it, is it’s keyboard. I fail to understand the unique keyboard design of mac and the purpose it achieves. They dared to remove the escape key in some of their recent versions. After well-deserved backlash (possibly from vim community), they had to bring it back and place with their feel-dead touch bar. Another madness is removal of backspace key and just to confuse PC users, the delete key works as backspace. Only an evil designer can think of this. And why do I need to press the function + delete for something as common as delete forward functionality? Sadly, in the name of minimalism, the story of removing keys from the keyboard does not stop here. You would not find Home, End, Insert, Page Up and Page Down keys even on 16”inch MacBook. Its not that mac has only removed keys, it has also introduced a new key; “Command key”, which basically commands me to insanity. What purpose do you achieve by adding a command key and borrowing some capabilities of ctrl key while leaving behind others. Why would you remove shortcut for cut command; ctrl+x, which I use more often than copy functionality. Why ctrl+c and ctrl+v are not default shortcuts for copy pasting files or folders. Why defaults to copy/pasting lines on a terminal require mouse click followed by choosing to copy or paste. After a month’s use of MacBook, I was so annoyed with these silly design choices that I would just use it for watching YouTube videos. Of course, you can’t beat the mac display, “the best” for entertainment. Working remotely on a MacBook was equally annoying for its poor x11 forwarding capabilities supported by XQuartz. At the same time, Windows 11 does a fabulous job with remote x11 forwarding.</p> <p>Reading through my rant, you might wonder why 90% of people in US either own or want to own a MacBook. My answer would be that in addition to marketing strategy, MacBook indeed offers some fantastic and attractive features. But that was not the focus of this blog. Fortunately, I bought a Lenovo which has Windows 11 with full built-in support for Linux operating system, best keyboard, best port arrangements, long battery life and shares many of the unmentioned attractive features of a MacBook.</p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=30ea76b15869" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
